# Connect 4 Game Outcome Prediction

We utilize early Connect 4 game states (8 turns elapsed with no player in position to win) to predict the outcome of the game. The dataset used is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning respository and contains over 67,557 unforced positions on the Connect 4 game board after 4 moves.
